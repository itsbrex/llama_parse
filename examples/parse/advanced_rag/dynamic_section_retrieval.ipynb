    "This notebook showcases a concept called \"dynamic section retrieval\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A common problem with naive RAG approaches is that each document is hierarchically organized by section, but standard chunking/retrieval searches for chunks that can be fragments of the entire section and miss out on relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic section retrieval takes into account entire contiguous sections as metadata during retrieval, avoiding the problem of retrieving section fragments. \n",
    "1. First, tag chunks of a long document with the sections they correspond to, through structured extraction.\n",
    "2. Do two-pass retrieval. After initial semantic search, dynamically pull in the entire section through metadata filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](dynamic_section_retrieval_img.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps provide a solution to the common chunking problem of retrieving chunks that are only subsets of the entire section you're meant to retrieve.\n",

      "Key findings about how difficulty correlates with context length\n",
      "\n",
      "- Performance falls as total input/context size grows. As the amount of code and other context provided to models increases, their ability to localize and produce correct edits drops noticeably (this behavior was observed across multiple models, e.g., Claude 2 and others).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Extra (irrelevant) context distracts models. When models are given a lot of code that is unrelated to the actual edit, they frequently struggle to find the problematic lines that need changing. This sensitivity includes the relative location of the target code within the larger context.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Increasing retriever recall doesn't fix it. Expanding retrieval windows (to include more files and therefore raise oracle recall) can actually hurt end-to-end performance because models become less effective at pinpointing the needed edits amid the extra material.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Collapsing context around the true edits helps. An ablation that collapses retrieved files to only the lines actually modified in the reference patch (±15 lines) improved results — for example, one model’s resolved rate rose from 4.8% to 5.9%, and another increased from ~1.3% to 3.4% — showing that concentrating context on the most relevant snippets makes the task easier.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Finetuned models are sensitive to context-distribution shifts. Models fine-tuned on tightly scoped (oracle) contexts performed worse when given BM25-retrieved context that contained many irrelevant files, indicating that training with one style of context can reduce robustness to different retrieval outputs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implications\n",
      "- Better retrieval or context-compression methods (e.g., more precise retrieval, collapsing to edited regions, or preprocessing to highlight likely relevant locations) are likely more useful than simply increasing context size.\n",
      "- Robust model behavior requires not just larger windows but mechanisms for localization and filtering of relevant code within long contexts.\n"

      "High-level summary\n",
      "- SWE-bench is a repository-scale, execution-validated benchmark of real GitHub issues paired with merged pull-request solutions. Each task gives a snapshot of a real codebase plus an issue description; the model must produce a patch that, when applied, makes the repository pass the tests that verify the issue was addressed.\n",
      "- The benchmark emphasizes realistic, hard software-engineering problems: large codebases, multi-file edits, long issue descriptions, and unit tests used for automatic verification.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data sources and collection\n",
      "- Candidate PRs are sourced from popular Python projects (selected from highly downloaded PyPI packages and mapped to their GitHub repositories). Repositories are filtered to ensure permissible licenses.\n",
      "- Pull requests are collected via the GitHub API and then filtered automatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "Task-instance selection criteria\n",
      "A PR becomes a candidate task only if it satisfies all of:\n",
      "- Status = merged (the PR was accepted).\n",
      "- The PR resolves one or more GitHub issues (detected via links like “fixes #N” in title/body/commits).\n",
      "- The PR introduces or edits test files (file paths containing test-related keywords).\n",
      "Only candidates that pass execution-based validation are kept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Task-instance components\n",
      "Each task instance encodes:\n",
      "- Codebase reference C: repo owner/name and the base commit (mirrored repositories are created so code can be retrieved reproducibly).\n",
      "- Problem statement P: aggregated issue titles and descriptions and any issue/PR comments up to the PR’s first commit (no post-solution comments that would leak the fix).\n",
      "- Tests T: the tests introduced/edited by the PR (extracted from the PR diff and stored as a .patch).\n",
      "- Solution δ (gold patch): the PR’s code changes excluding test edits (stored as a .patch).\n",
      "- Metadata fields: base_commit, created_at, instance_id, issue_numbers, repo, pull_number, version, env_install_commit, hints_text (collected comments), and cached test result mappings like FAIL_TO_PASS and PASS_TO_PASS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Execution-based validation (quality control)\n",
      "- Virtual execution contexts are created per repository release version (manual inspection of README/contributing to determine Python version, dependencies, install commands). Conda environments are used.\n",
      "- For each candidate instance the pipeline:\n",
      "  1. Checks out the base commit.\n",
      "  2. Installs the codebase in the corresponding env.\n",
      "  3. Applies the test patch T and runs tests (log_pre).\n",
      "  4. Applies the solution patch δ and runs tests again (log_post).\n",
      "- Candidates are discarded if any step fails (checkout, install, apply patch, test run).\n",
      "- Instances are retained only if at least one test changes from fail → pass (a true FAIL_TO_PASS) and if there are no trivial issues (e.g., ImportError or AttributeError in log_pre that indicate missing dependency/name issues).\n",
      "- Instances whose tests exercise newly created functions/classes (i.e., tests requiring names introduced by δ) are excluded because they would be impossible to solve from the problem statement alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Task-instance format and artifacts\n",
      "- Finalized instances are saved in a single JSON file (task metadata and patch contents are included as patch-format strings).\n",
      "- For each instance the validation engine caches parsed test-to-status mappings for log_pre/log_post and creates ground-truth lists: FAIL_TO_PASS, PASS_TO_PASS (used during evaluation to check both that the fix was implemented and that prior behavior is preserved).\n",
      "- Mirrors of original repositories are created and stored to preserve exact base commits and enable reproducible checkout.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation procedure (how models are scored)\n",
      "- Model input: problem statement P and the codebase C (usually limited by retrieval/long-context strategy). The model must generate a single .patch (a git/unified-diff style patch).\n",
      "- Per predicted patch the evaluation harness:\n",
      "  1. Resets repo to base commit.\n",
      "  2. Activates the executable context for the instance version.\n",
      "  3. Installs the codebase.\n",
      "  4. Applies the test patch T.\n",
      "  5. Attempts to apply the predicted patch \\hat{δ}. If applying fails, an automatic \"patch-fix\" step tries to repair the patch (e.g., strip extraneous context lines and recalculate headers); if it still fails the prediction is scored as failure.\n",
      "  6. Runs the repository’s test command to generate log_{\\hat{δ}}.\n",
      "  7. Parses log_{\\hat{δ}} into a test-to-status mapping using repository-specific parsers.\n",
      "  8. Declares the task solved only if all tests listed in FAIL_TO_PASS and PASS_TO_PASS have status = pass in log_{\\hat{δ}}.\n",
      "- The principal metric is % Resolved: fraction of task instances fully solved (all required tests pass).\n",
      "\n",
      "Patch-fixing and robustness\n",
      "- If a generated patch does not apply, the harness attempts an automated repair (e.g., removing context lines, fixing header offsets) before giving up. Applied-but-broken patches that then fail tests are classified according to pass/fail patterns (Resolved, Breaking Resolved, Partially Resolved, Work-in-Progress, No-Op, Regression) to provide finer-grained analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dataset scale and characterization\n",
      "- Raw crawl: ~93k PRs across selected repositories; after conversion/filters and execution validation the final evaluation set contains 2,294 task instances.\n",
      "- Instances come from 12 widely used Python repositories with varied sizes and purposes (e.g., scikit-learn, Django, matplotlib, requests, pytest, sympy, astropy, etc.).\n",
      "- Typical instance properties: long problem descriptions (median ~140 words), large repositories (median ~thousands of files and hundreds of thousands of lines), and reference edits that usually touch ~1–2 files, edit a few functions, and modify a few dozen lines on average.\n",
      "- Tests: each instance has at least one FAIL_TO_PASS; many instances include many PASS_TO_PASS tests for regression protection (median tens to hundreds of pass-to-pass tests).\n",
      "\n",
      "Development set, train set, and extensions\n",
      "- A smaller development set (~225 instances, >10% of the main set) is provided for tuning and debugging.\n",
      "- A separate SWE-bench-train dataset (19k non-testing task instances from many repos) was prepared for fine-tuning models; fine-tuned models were released (SWE-Llama 7B and 13B) to study open-model performance on long contexts.\n",
      "- The collection pipeline and mirror strategy were designed to be easily extendable so the benchmark can be updated continuously with new PRs and support additional languages or repos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reproducibility and release commitments\n",
      "- The codebase used to collect, validate, and evaluate task instances is organized and documented; mirrors and the JSON of task instances are provided so others can reproduce experiments.\n",
      "- Execution contexts, validation logs, and ground-truth test mappings are cached to avoid re-running expensive validation at evaluation time.\n",
      "- Plans include open-sourcing the task instances, collection/evaluation infrastructure, training data used for fine-tuning, and model weights along with documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design decisions and safeguards\n",
      "- Using merged PRs that added tests provides a strong ground-truth signal that the PR truly solved the issue and allowed for reproducible verification.\n",
      "- Excluding instances with trivial dependency/name errors or tests that require newly-introduced symbol names ensures tasks are solvable from the given P + C without hidden knowledge.\n",
      "- Mirroring repositories preserves commit history and avoids breakage from later upstream edits.\n",
      "\n",
      "What solving a task means (concrete criterion)\n",
      "- A generated patch must apply and, after applying the repository’s tests, every test that the validation flagged as verifying the issue (FAIL_TO_PASS) must now pass, and all tests that previously passed but were intended to remain passing (PASS_TO_PASS) must still pass. Only then is the task counted as solved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Utility and intended uses\n",
      "- The benchmark measures model ability to: localize defects, reason across a large codebase, produce multi-line and multi-file edits in patch format, and use execution feedback (tests) as verification.\n",
      "- It is intended both as a hard evaluation for current models and as a development target for models and systems that perform repository-scale code edits, retrieval from large codebases, iterative editing with execution feedback, or agent-style multi-step repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations to be aware of\n",
      "- The benchmark focuses on repositories with permissive licenses and decent test coverage (popular projects), so it emphasizes bug fixes and features that were covered by tests and merged in those projects.\n",
      "- Some tasks that require creating new symbol names first introduced in the solution are excluded because they would not be solvable from the baseline inputs.\n",
      "- Execution environments are created per release version (manual aspects exist), and some instances are discarded when installation or environment setup cannot be reliably reproduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, SWE-bench provides a large, execution-validated, reproducible suite of real-world repository-scale code-editing tasks that require understanding long contexts and producing correct patch-format edits verified by the project’s own tests.\n"

      "- Skill parameterizations used in these visualizations: 2-D continuous skills for Ant and Humanoid, 4-D continuous skills for Quadruped, 16 discrete skills for HalfCheetah.\n",
      "- Main finding: across 8 random seeds METRA consistently discovers diverse locomotion behaviors (radial/x-y coverage, different locomotion modes) regardless of seed. The paper shows multiple sample trajectories per seed to illustrate robustness and diversity.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Latent-space visualization\n",
      "- Setup: METRA trained with 2-D continuous latent space on Ant (state inputs) and Humanoid (pixel inputs).\n",
      "- Observation: the learned representation φ(s) captures the agent’s x-y coordinates in the 2-D latent space in both Ant and Humanoid. The learned φ trajectories align with the x-y trajectories, indicating METRA finds the temporally most spread-out manifold (x-y plane) even from pixels.\n",
      "- Note: with higher-dimensional or discrete latent spaces, METRA captures more diverse, non-linear behaviors beyond simple locomotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Ablation: effect of latent-space size on learned skills\n",
      "- Latent-space sizes tested: 1-D, 2-D, 4-D continuous; discrete sets of sizes {2}, {4}, {8}, {16}, {24}.\n",
      "- Environments: Ant and HalfCheetah.\n",
      "- Result: skill diversity increases as the capacity (dimensionality / cardinality) of Z grows.\n",
      "  - 1-D: simple linear/one-dimensional coverage\n",
      "  - 2-D: radial coverage / 2-D spread\n",
      "  - 4-D: more complex radial / richer behaviors\n",
      "  - Discrete increases produce progressively more distinct discrete behaviors (more segments, more diverse skill classes)\n",
      "- Conclusion: METRA maximizes state coverage under latent capacity, so increasing Z’s capacity yields more diverse discovered behaviors.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Additional baseline: DGPO comparison (discrete-skill comparison; 4 seeds)\n",

      "    - METRA: 6313.25 ± 747.92\n",
      "- Interpretation given: DGPO (which maximizes a metric-agnostic KL-style objective in discrete Z) still produces limited state coverage similar to DIAYN, whereas METRA (a metric-aware Wasserstein formulation) achieves substantially greater coverage in these locomotion environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Skill examples / qualitative descriptions by latent size\n",
      "- A tabulated description shows how skills change qualitatively with latent-size choices (examples):\n",
      "  - Ant (continuous Z):\n",
      "    - 1-D: linearly increasing coverage\n",
      "    - 2-D: radial coverage with 2-D spread\n",
      "    - 4-D: more complex radial coverage\n",

      "- Queue state coverage: computed from most recent 100,000 training trajectories (used for some comparisons).\n",
      "- Total state coverage: computed from the entire set of training trajectories up to the current epoch (used as a generous metric for pure-exploration baselines).\n",
      "- For locomotion coverage counting: x-y bins of 1×1 are counted for Ant, Quadruped, Humanoid; x bins for HalfCheetah. Kitchen uses task success counts for pre-defined subtasks.\n",
      "- Seeds: most qualitative and skill-discovery comparisons use 8 seeds; the DGPO comparison reported used 4 seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Additional notes and takeaways from the extra experiments\n",
      "- METRA’s learned φ(s) is effective for zero-shot goal selection because φ preserves temporal distances; the latent difference φ(g) − φ(s) gives a direction in Z to reach a goal.\n",
      "- Increasing latent capacity helps but requires choosing continuous vs. discrete Z appropriately for the desired types of behaviors.\n",
      "- The DGPO comparison further supports that metric-aware objectives (METRA) lead to substantially higher state coverage than metric-agnostic mutual-information/KL-style objectives.\n",
