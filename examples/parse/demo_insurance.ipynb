      "- Sum Insured / maximum limit for that benefit.  \n",
      "- Deductible (amount you must absorb per claim).  \n",
      "- Any compensation already paid by the airline or other source (this is deducted from the insurer’s payment).  \n",
      "- Reason for the delay and whether it’s an excluded reason (e.g., delay was publicly known 6+ hours before departure).\n",
      "\n",
      "How to calculate (general rules)\n",
      "- If the policy reimburses actual alternate travel costs: insurer pays up to the Sum Insured, but subtract any compensation from the carrier and subtract the deductible. Payment = min(Sum Insured, your expense) − carrier compensation − deductible.\n",
      "- If the policy pays a fixed amount per block of hours: determine how many blocks your 8-hour delay covers (e.g., if a block is 4 hours, 8 hours = 2 blocks). Payment = blocks × fixed amount (subject to any stated maximum and any applicable deductible/offsets).\n",
      "\n",
      "Two simple examples\n",
      "- Reimbursement example: Sum Insured ≥ $450, deductible $50, airline paid $0 → insurer would pay $450 − $50 = $400.  \n",
      "- Fixed-per-block example: certificate pays $100 per 4-hour block. 8 hours = 2 blocks → insurer would pay 2 × $100 = $200 (subject to any max limit or deductible if applicable).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you share the certificate values (which benefit, sum insured, deductible, fixed-per-block amount if any, and any airline compensation), I’ll compute the exact amount.\n",
      "With instructions:\n",
      "The amount payable depends on the Trip Delay benefit sum insured you chose in your policy certificate. Available Trip Delay benefit options are: 1K, 2K, 3K, 4K, 5K, 7.5K, 10K, 15K and 20K. The insurer pays the selected benefit amount for each block of delay hours as defined in your certificate (maximum up to 24 hours).\n",
